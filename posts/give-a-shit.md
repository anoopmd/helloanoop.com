You don't need to be passionate, or be the smartest person in your team.

But please care.  <br />
Care for the code that you are contributing. <br />
Care for the next person who will inherit your code. <br />
Care for the product that you are building and the impact that it will have on the end-users.

Just care. <br />
Give a shit about whatever you do, beyond getting the task/userstory completed.
