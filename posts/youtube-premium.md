I finally caved in and bought the YouTube Premium subscription to get rid of ads.

It was the donation ads that got to me. I was reminded of the suffering that exists in the world every 5 mins. After a while I couldn't watch it anymore.

Not saying that raising awareness around charitable causes via ads is bad.

Remind me once in a day. <br/>
Fine. Thrice a day. <br/>
But Damn. Not every 5 mins. <br/>
