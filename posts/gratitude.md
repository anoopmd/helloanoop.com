Feeling incredibly grateful.

For the fact that I have a roof to sleep under, a cozy bed, a warm blanket to slid inside. Compared to millions of less privileged people who have to sleep on the road.

A decent job where I get paid for the stuff that I like doing, good health, parents who loved me and continue to, going to marry my sweetheart, some good friends.

What more could I ask for.

Of course there are things that I wish were different(like I wish I didn't have a squint eye), but it doesn't take away the fact that I am so so so incredibly blessed and lucky to have the things I have today when compared millions of other less privileged people who would be ready to exchange  my position with theirs within a blink of an eye.
