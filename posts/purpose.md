Everything I know today is saying that there is no inherent purpose in life. <br/>

There is no way in this vast universe, among 8 people living people, many many dead in the past, that I have some purpose to fulfil. <br/>

I am a worm. <br/>
A speck with no signficance. <br/>

In the end everyone dies. <br/>
The heat death of the universe. <br/>
