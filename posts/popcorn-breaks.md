I wonder - how big of a difference in experience would it be if Indian Cinemas didn't have a popcorn break.

Watched Oppenheimer. Really good movie. The score is ineffable.

What if. Just what if - you got to see the movie, in one go, completely immersed.

We are denied of the emotions that dawn upon you in the ending scene of Oppenheimer, had you seen it in a single go.

One can only imagine.
