One Day. <br/>
I want to feel what a SpaceX engineer feels. <br/>
A piece of the code that they wrote <br/>
On that rocket <br/>
The thunderous sound that the rocket makes <br/>
As it leaves the launch pad <br/>
Climbing higher and higher <br/>
To the heavens <br/>
To Mars <br/> <br/>

That will be a beautiful day.
